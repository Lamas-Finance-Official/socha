# SOCHA - Web3 platform for charitable fundraising using blockchain to ensure authenticity and transparency

## Project Description:
Our project is a web3 platform designed to facilitate charitable fundraising through cryptocurrency. With SoCha, users can create campaigns and add information about their charitable cause. Each campaign will be associated with a contract account, allowing for secure and transparent tracking of donations.

Users can contribute to campaigns using cryptocurrency, such as USDC, providing a simple and efficient way to donate to their favourite causes. Campaign creators can also transfer ownership of their campaigns to other users if desired.

In addition, each contributor will automatically have a charitable profile recorded, allowing them to track their donations and contributions over time. This feature aims to encourage a culture of giving and inspire others to support charitable causes.

Overall, our web3 platform aims to make charitable giving more accessible, transparent, and efficient, leveraging the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to create a more equitable world.
